# **Password generator**

## **Project requierements**

Create a component responsible for generating passwords based on various options selected by the user. The user can select the following options:

-   Password length
-   Special characters
-   Numbers
-   Capital letters

The generated password should meet the selected criteria. Once the password has been generated, we show the masked password. We also give the user the option to view and copy the password.
